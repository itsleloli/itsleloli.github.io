    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 21px; font-weight: normal;">
        This project was made as my 2nd year's final project, I convinced my teachers to allow me to work with a group of people I've worked with before and knew I could work. Which worked out amazingly because our group won best game of the year in our school's competition!
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 21px; font-weight: normal;">
        This project also had it's own rules / requirements.

        <li>It had to have 3 Levels</li>
        <li>The levels were referred to as a "cell" and could not exceed 20 meters in length, width, or height (20x20x20 meters).</li>
        <li>You had to solve the current cell u were in, before being able to continue onto the next cell.</li>
        <li>The game had to have one mechanic that came back in every cell.</li>

    <h2>Team</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 21px; font-weight: normal;">
        This was a relatively big group consisting of 2 Developers and 4 Artists, mainly big on the art side for a school project, which because we communicated very well between each other worked wonders.
    </p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">
        <strong>Team Members: 6</strong>
        <ul class="text-muted lead" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">
            <strong>Developers</strong>
            <li>Leandro Bonora (Scrum master, Level Design, Programming)</li>

            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: lighter;">
                I would like to quickly mention the special credit towards Hikaru Shirosu, we coincidentally found his music during the production of the game,
                and I loved it so much I think I listened to his music almost everyday. And after a while I realized how nicely his music would fit in our game.
                So I ended up reaching out to Hikaru and he loved the idea and allowed us to use his music in our game, which I'll forever be grateful for! 
                If ur interested check his music!
                <a href="https://youtube.com/@HikaruShirosu?si=Y5v3WKebiPoNe7g9 " target="_blank">His Youtube Channel</a> 
                I highly recommend: Prelude No.3, Final Stars.

    <p class="text-left text-muted lead">
        I have to admit it took some time to get everything fleshed out, especially the 1 reocurring game mechanic we wanted. when we did eventually settle on our game mechanic we went all out.
        I worked on a variety of things which includes level design, pitch deck design, optimization/polish by using methods such as occlusion culling, I was also very involved with my Artists because I think it's very beneficial to do so especially as Scrum Master.
    </p>

    <p class="text-left text-muted lead">
        A couple of examples of the stuff I worked on are: All Menu's, AudioManager, Platform, Bookspawner and the DialogueSystem

    <p>Teleport Player</p>
</div>
<div class="text-left text-left">
    <p class="text-left text-muted lead">For this idea, I was inspired by Antichamber, and I wanted to add a non-euclidean room. It was a bit tricky to work with since the room only allowed for 20mÂ³, so I had to become creative with the space we had. After playtesting, we did alter the design (Mainly instead of 2 doors at the front/top, only 1).</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-left text-muted lead">It basically works as follows: no matter if you go up or down the stairs, you will always end up on the middle floor again. Once teleported, there will be a wall as soon as you round the corner, so you can't proceed. Most players end up going through the door they saw before meeting a dead end. This, in turn, puts them back on the middle floor. The solution is to, once teleported, simply go backward and through the fake wall behind you.</p>

            It tracks the player's precise coordinates on this plane.  
            To make teleporting the player as smooth and seamless as possible when teleported the player arrives in another hallway with the original position they had
            and an added 90-degree camera rotation. Which if they now open the door infront of them it's the same cell they originally came from.

            <p class="text-left text-muted lead"> I have given the entire script but I will be highlighting: Next Line works by first checking if there are any more lines left to write and if there are any lines 
                (So a whole sentence).
                It will start writing those by calling the Coroutine TypeLine.
                <br>
                The coroutine TypeLine will then for each character in the current line will type it out and wait for the specified time 
                and keep doing that until there are no more characters left. which results in a nice letter for letter dialogue system.

            I really enjoyed this project a lot, I spent way too much time on this project but it was so fun especially seeing everytime come together was so nice. I wouldn't have done a lot differently than from the way I did things.  
            <br>
            <br>
            The one thing I would've liked to do better was probably coming up with the Mechanic and having a clear idea for it. However I feel like that comes with time and is something I am actively trying to improve on.

            My favorite part has to be the fact we got personal permission from Hikaru Shirosu to use his music, in general the whole interaction with him was very wholesome and I loved it.
